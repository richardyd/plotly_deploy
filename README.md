# Module 12 Challenge - Bacterial Mapping Demographics

## Project Overview
This challenge relies on survey data and provides, through sets of visual display, the mapping of the 
top 10 bacteria found in the surveyed candidates.

## Resources
- Data Source: samples.json
- Internet
- Software: knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js

## Summary
The application works as a dashboard. It presents the user with a means to visualize the bio-diversity by
candidate. Each candidate gets identified by a unique id. Those Ids get initially loaded in a drop-down.
When a user selects an id, the application would offer the following:
1) the demographic info of the subject;
2) the Top 10 bacteria cultures found in the subject - bar chart;
3) the bacteria cultures per sample;
4) a belly button hygiene indicator.

This challenge has allowed us to get acquainted to hosting pages via GitHub. It has also helped me comprehend
better the technology used for this challenge.
